== Container Native Storage

You can install GlusterFS in a container and run it on OpenShift.
Furthermore you can use `heketi` to dynamically create volumes to use.

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html-single/container-native_storage_for_openshift_container_platform/[Official
Docs]

=== Prereqs

[arabic]
. A fully functioning OCP v3.7 environment
. At least 3 nodes (minimum) with at least 250GB raw/unformated disc
attached to them
. If you have a POC env with one master and two nodes; you’re going to
*_need_* to use the master as a node
. Fully functioning DNS (forward AND reverse)
. Access to the entitlements that provides the following entitlements
* `rh-gluster-3-client-for-rhel-7-server-rpms`

Thigs to keep in mind (_DO NOT SKIP OVER THIS; PLEASE READ_)

* Ensure that the Trusted Storage Pool is not scaled beyond 100 volumes
per 3 nodes per 32G of RAM.
* A trusted storage pool consists of a minimum of 3 nodes/peers.
* Distributed-Three-way replication is the only supported volume type.

=== Host Setup

Included in this repo is a playbook that will prepare your nodes using
your existing ansible host file.

....
ansible-playbook ./resources/cns-host-prepare.yaml
....

_NOTE:_ If you’re using your `master` as a CNS node, it needs to be in
the `[node]` section of your ansible host file
(e.g. `/etc/ansible/hosts`)

=== Create OpenShift Project

Create a project for your gluster node

_IF_ you have 3 nodes run:

....
oc adm new-project glusterfs
oc project glusterfs
....

If you only have 2 nodes and _need_ to use your master as a node; run:

....
oc adm manage-node ose3-master.example.com --schedulable
oc adm new-project glusterfs --node-selector=""
oc project glusterfs
....

Next, enable privileged containers on this project

....
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n glusterfs
....

=== Deploying Container-Native Storage

You must first provide a topology file for heketi which describes the
topology of the Red Hat Gluster Storage nodes and their attached storage
devices. A sample, formatted topology file (topology-sample.json) is
installed with the `heketi-client` package in the `/usr/share/heketi/`
directory.

This is the config I used on my AWS instance (I’m using my master as a
node) saved as `cns.json`:

[source,json]

                    ]
                },
                {
                    "node": {
                        "hostnames": {
                            "manage": [

                            ],

                            ]
                        },
                        "zone": 2

                    "devices": [
                        "/dev/xvdf"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "node": {
                        "hostnames": {
                            "manage": [

                            ],
                            "storage": [
                                "172.31.24.220"
                            ]
                        },
                        "zone": 3
                    },
                    "devices": [
                        "/dev/xvdf"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
----

*Things to note*

* The `manage` is the hostname (REQUIRED) that openshift sees
(i.e. `oc get nodes`) and the `storage` is the ip of that host
(REQUIRED)
* The device `/dev/xvdf` is a _RAW_ storage deviced attached and
unformated (no partitions, no LVM flags, nothing).
* I’ve ran into trouble with drives less than 100GB…the ones I used are
250GB each. If you’re going to use block. You’ll need the 250GB.
* Normally, you’d want one server/node per `zone` (thus increment the
number for each node). Think of `zone` as a failure domain

Install with

....
cns-deploy -n glusterfs -g -y -c oc \
--object-account object-vol --object-user object-admin --object-password itsmine \
--block-host 30 cns.json
....

Command options are

* `-n` : namespace/project name
* `-g` : Deploy GlusterFS nodes
* `-y` : Assume ``yes'' to questions
* `-c` : The command line utility to use (you can use `oc` or `kubectl`)
* `cns.json` : Path to the topology JSON file
* `--object-*` : These options (self explanitory) set up configurations
specific to object storage
* `--block-host`: This is the default amount of storage to allocate if
no size is specified (in GB). Set this to something that makes sense

=== Configure Heketi CLI

Export `HEKETI_CLI_SERVER` with the route so you can connect to the API

....
export  HEKETI_CLI_SERVER=http://$(oc get routes heketi --no-headers -n glusterfs | awk '{print $2}')
....

I would save this in `/etc/bashrc`

Run the following command to see if everything is working

....
heketi-cli topology info
....

=== Dynamically Creating PVs from PVCs

You need to first create a `storageClass` (it might be different now -
look
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/storage_examples/gluster_dynamic_example.html#create-a-storage-class-for-your-glusterfs-dynamic-provisioner[here]
)

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: gluster-container
provisioner: kubernetes.io/glusterfs
parameters:
  resturl: "http://heketi-glusterfs.apps.example.com"
  restuser: "admin"
  secretNamespace: "default"
  secretName: "heketi-secret"
  volumetype: "replicate:3"
----

Things to note

* `resturl` : The route you exported earlier (this can be the `svc` ip
address if you want)
* `restuser` : The user to hit the API with (by default it’s `admin` so
stick with that)
* `secretNamespace` : Namespace where your secret is (more on that
below)
* `secretName` : The name of that secret
* `volumetype` : It specifies the volume type that is being used.
Distributed-Three-way replication is the only supported volume type. You
can also put `volumetype: none` for testing purposes
* If you’d like to make this a default storage class; add an annotation.
Here’s an link:resources/gluster-default-storageclass.yaml[example]

Now, create a secret; by default heketi uses ``My Secret'' as the
password so run…

....
echo -n "My Secret" | base64
TXkgU2VjcmV0
....

Now use that output to create the secret

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: heketi-secret
  namespace: default
data:
  key: TXkgU2VjcmV0
type: kubernetes.io/glusterfs
----

Load both of these files

....
oc create -f glusterfs-secret.yaml
oc create -f glusterfs-storageclass.yaml
....

If you want to use your CNS installation as the default storage
provider; annotate accordingly!

....
oc annotate storageclass gluster-container storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class="true"
....

=== Setting up block storage provisioner

CNS uses `iscsi` for it’s block storage. You need to prepare _all_ your
masters/nodes to use `iscsi`. Therefore, make sure you’ve ran the
link:#host-setup[Host Setup] setps above. (i.e. You’ve ran that
playbook…if you’re come this far, you probably already did).

Create a secret file to use the provisioner REST url (similar to what
you did above).

....
echo -n "mypassword" | base64
bXlwYXNzd29yZA==
....

Now create the secret YAML file

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: heketi-secret-block
  namespace: default
data:
  key: bXlwYXNzd29yZA==
type: gluster.org/glusterblock
----

After that, create the `storageClass` similar to what you created above.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: gluster-block
provisioner: gluster.org/glusterblock
parameters:
 resturl: "http://heketi-storage-project.apps.example.com"
 restuser: "admin"
 restsecretnamespace: "default"
 restsecretname: "heketi-secret-block"
 hacount: "3"
 clusterids: "7ec3fb839bb0488a3377621c7112b39e"
 chapauthenabled: "true"
----

NOTE: You get your `clusterid` from the heketi cli

....
$ heketi-cli cluster list
Clusters:
Id:7ec3fb839bb0488a3377621c7112b39e [file][block]
....

Once, you have both of these YAML files ready, you can import them in.

....
$ oc create -f block-secret.yaml
secret "heketi-secret-block" created

$ oc create -f glusterfs-block-sc.yaml
storageclass "gluster-block" created
....

=== Conclusion

You should now be setup for file, block, and object storage

....
$ oc get storageclass
NAME                TYPE
gluster-block       gluster.org/glusterblock
gluster-container   kubernetes.io/glusterfs
glusterfs-for-s3    kubernetes.io/glusterfs
....
