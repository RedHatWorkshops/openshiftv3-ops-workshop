== Managing Users Overview

In this lab you will learn how OpenShift manages users and how
authentication is handled. You will also learn how to add/delete users
from the OpenShift platform.

=== Step 1

OpenShift takes ``hands off'' approach in regaurds to users. That is,
OpenShift does not manage users directly. Instead it ``offloads'' the
user administration to whatever mechanism you choose.

Currently supported authentication methods are:

* LDAP
* HTPassword File
* Github
* Gitlab
* OpenID
* Google
* Request Header

By default, openshift uses `htpasswd` and a ``flat file'' for
authentication. Take a look at this configuration.

....
grep -A9 identityProviders /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml 
  identityProviders:
  - challenge: true
    login: true
    mappingMethod: claim
    name: htpasswd_auth
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      file: /etc/openshift/openshift-passwd
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider
  masterCA: ca-bundle.crt
....

This configuration says that when a users tries to login; send the
request to this flat file. Take a look at the users currently on the
system.

....
oc get users
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME       IDENTITIES
demo      72455092-6dad-11e7-b505-5254005e6599                   Local Authentication:demo
....

=== Step 2

To add a user into OpenShift; just add the user to the backend
authentication system. In this case; we use the `htpasswd` command to
update the flat file.

....
htpasswd /etc/openshift/openshift-passwd user1
New password: 
Re-type new password: 
Adding password for user user1

cat /etc/openshift/openshift-passwd 
demo:$apr1$tuMj6pjc$uHo8IoNUoK0mGx6omnI1l1
user1:$apr1$dYwgH8a9$0IjfdOm2DsN7.LvdBRV6F0
....

Now check OpenShift. Note that the user you just created is not there.

....
oc get users
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME       IDENTITIES
demo      72455092-6dad-11e7-b505-5254005e6599                   Local Authentication:demo
....

Using the webui or the `oc` command; login using this new user.

*NOTE* Do this from your workstation, not on the Master.

Example

....
oc login -u user1
Authentication required for https://master.example.com:8443 (openshift)
Username: user1
Password: 
Login successful.

You dont have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

oc whoami
user1
....

Now take a look at your users

....
oc get users
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME       IDENTITIES
demo      72455092-6dad-11e7-b505-5254005e6599                   Local Authentication:demo
user1     b40b2c5f-6e47-11e7-b505-5254005e6599                   Local Authentication:user1
....

What happened? OpenShift creates a corresponding user once a successful
authentication happens.

=== Step 3

Now we will go through the steps of deleting a user. First step is to
remove/lock the user account in the backend authentication method. In
this case, it is as easy as removing them from the file.

....
sed -i '/^user1/d' /etc/openshift/openshift-passwd 

cat /etc/openshift/openshift-passwd
demo:$apr1$tuMj6pjc$uHo8IoNUoK0mGx6omnI1l1
....

Take a look at the users

....
oc get users
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME       IDENTITIES
demo      72455092-6dad-11e7-b505-5254005e6599                   Local Authentication:demo
user1     b40b2c5f-6e47-11e7-b505-5254005e6599                   Local Authentication:user
....

Once you have locked/deleted a user from the backend authentication
system. Just simply delete the user

....
oc delete user user1
user "user1" deleted
....

You should now see the user gone from the list

....
oc get users
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME       IDENTITIES
demo      72455092-6dad-11e7-b505-5254005e6599                   Local Authentication:demo
....

*Re-Using the User* If you want to re-use this user with a later lab
module, you will also need to run the following to finish cleaning up
the user from the backend:

....
oc delete identity htpasswd_auth:user1
....

*CLEANUP:* If this user was an admin/owner of any projects; those
projects would still exist. You just need to assign them to different
users.

=== Conclusion

In this lab you learned how users are managed inside of OpenShift. You
also go familiar with authentication and how that is handled in
OpenShift
