In this lab you will safely remove a node from the Openshift Cluster.

....
$ oc get nodes
....

=== determine the node you want to remove, make it unschedulable

....
$ oc adm manage-node <node>  --schedulable=false
....

=== ensure it is correctly labeled as unschedulable

....
$ oc get nodes
....

=== e.g.

....
ip-172-31-21-67.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready,SchedulingDisabled   compute   10d       v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
....

=== evacuate pods

....
$ oc adm drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data --force
....

=== check that the node has no running pods

....
$ oc adm manage-node <node> --list-pods
....

=== delete nodes
