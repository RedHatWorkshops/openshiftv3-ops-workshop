== Provisioning Instructions

=== File Structure

=== `_modules.yml`

Lists all labs, their dependencies and where the lab content is hosted
(GitHub, web server, etc). Note that this file has to be in the root of
the repository.

=== `_devday_workshop.yml`

A yaml file with arbitrary name that specifies which labs should be
included in the rendered workshop guide. Note that the lab names should
already be listed in `_modules.yml`. It goes without going that you can
have multiple of these yaml files to customize your workshop for
different purposes. See the `_workshop_sample.yml` for a reference on
how to create your own.

=== `*.md` or `*.adoc`

The actual lab instructions depending on which markup language you have
chosen (specified in `_modules.yml`). Node that the name of the file
should be the exact same name as the key in `_modules.yml`.

=== Deploy On OpenShift

You can deploy Workshopper as a container image anywhere but most
conveniently, you can deploy it on OpenShift Online or other OpenShift
flavors:

....
oc new-app quay.io/osevg/workshopper --name=opsworkshop -e WORKSHOPS_URLS="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/openshiftv3-ops-workshop/asciidoc/_module_groups.yml" -e ISSUES_URL="https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/openshiftv3-workshop/issues" -e LOG_TO_STDOUT=true -e JAVA_APP=false
$ oc expose svc/myworkshop
....

The lab content (`.md` and `.adoc` files) will be pulled from the GitHub
when users access the workshopper in their browser.

You can convert .MD to .ADOC using Pandoc tool

....
$ pandoc -s idling_applications.md -t asciidoc -o idling_applications.adoc
....

Note that the workshop variables can be overriden via specifying
environment variables on the container itself e.g.Â the `JAVA_APP` env
var in the above command

=== Test Locally with Docker

You can directly run Workshopper as a docker container which is
specially helpful when writing the content.

....
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/app-data \
              -e CONTENT_URL_PREFIX="file:///app-data" \
              -e WORKSHOPS_URLS="file:///app-data/_devday_workshop.yml" \
              quay.io/osevg/workshopper
....

Go to http://localhost:8080 on your browser to see the rendered workshop
content. You can modify the lab instructions and refresh the page to see
the latest changes.
