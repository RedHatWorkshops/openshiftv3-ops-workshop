== Deploying Cockpit As A Container

In this lab you will learn how to deploy cockpit as a container. This is
useful for when you have an installation (like a cloud based install)
where the `root' user is locked, does not have a password, or is
otherwise unavailable.

=== Step 1 - Create An Admin User

This step has two outcomes. It gives you a user that you can view
information about your cluster, and it has the side effect of giving you
an ``admin'' user (i.e. like a ``root'' user).

If you already have a user in mind or are going to be using an LDAP user
you can skip the below command. Otherwise, create the `ocp-admin` using
the below command.

....
htpasswd /etc/origin/openshift-passwd ocp-admin
....

Next (whether you are using LDAP or this `ocp-admin` user), grant the
`cluster-admin` role to this user for the entire cluster.

....
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin ocp-admin
....

=== Step 2

Now that we have our user; we will create a project to house the
`cockpit` interface.

....
oc new-project cockpit
oc project cockpit
....

Next, we will be using the
https://github.com/charlesrichard/cockpit/tree/master/containers[official
cockpit] repoistory to create our application. This repo provides an
https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/blob/master/containers/openshift-cockpit.template[OpenShift
Template] for us to use. We will process this template using customer
parameters.

....
cd ~
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/master/containers/openshift-cockpit.template
oc process --param="COCKPIT_KUBE_URL=https://cockpit.apps.example.com" \
--param="OPENSHIFT_OAUTH_PROVIDER_URL=https://ocp.example.com:8443" \
--param=COCKPIT_KUBE_INSECURE="false" \
--param="OPENSHIFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=cockpit-oauth-webui" \
-f openshift-cockpit.template | oc create -f -
....

Few things to note

* `COCKPIT_KUBE_INSECURE` - I am setting this to `false` because I want
this to go through SSL
* `COCKPIT_KUBE_URL` - This is the URL for the cockpit route I want to
use (note the use of `https://`)
* `OPENSHIFT_OAUTH_PROVIDER_URL` - This should be set to your master
console URL.
* `OPENSHIFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - This is a uniqe name for the oauth
client

Just like any OpenShift app; this creates a variety of objects. The most
important being an `oauthclient`. Inspect this resource.

....
oc get oauthclient cockpit-oauth-webui -o yaml
....

This should output something like this

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: OAuthClient
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2017-07-20T21:17:07Z
  labels:
    createdBy: cockpit-openshift-template
  name: cockpit-oauth-client
  resourceVersion: "3540070"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/oauthclients/cockpit-oauth-client
  uid: c8f7bf45-6d90-11e7-9df9-02085f46c5fa
redirectURIs:
- https://cockpit.apps.example.com/
secret: user772sFA51njDJdTd3kvjGnOYfuxqQtSwhxiOMO3J2JossdH8Kr1IndqmylrxQSkqJ
----

This is basically saying ``Anytime someone visits
`https://cockpit.apps.example.com/`, use OpenShift’s oauth for
authentication''.

Verify the pod is running

....
oc get pods -n cockpit
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-cockpit-1-fh49x   1/1       Running   0          13m
....

Now create the route

....
oc create route passthrough --service=openshift-cockpit --hostname=cockpit.apps.example.com --port=9090 --insecure-policy=Redirect openshift-cockpit
....

=== Step 3

This step allows you to play around a bit. Visit your cockpit interface
at the route you specified (in this example it is:
`https://cockpit.apps.example.com/`). You will notice that it redirects
you to the familiar OpenShift login page. Login using the `ocp-admin`
(or whichever user you used).

This should redirect you to the cockpit overview page

Feel free to play around and see information about your entire cluster.
This gives information about

* Nodes
* Containers (and the ability to shell to them)
* Topology
* Detailed information about objects
* Volumes
* Images from your Registry
* Detailed infromation about Projects

=== Conclusion

In this lab you learned how to create a user that has admin privilages
(that is to say, how to asign a new ``root'' user). You also got an
overview how OpenShift can be used to ``offload'' authentication by
using its oauth client capabilites.

You also got a view on how an administrator can see information about
the OpenShift cluster at a glance.
